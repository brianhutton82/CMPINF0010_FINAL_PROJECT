    "<p>Each neighborhood in Pittsburgh has its own unique appeal but most people can agree that the quality of the environment is a major contributing factor when considering a place to live. Not many people want to live next to a polluted river or breath in polluted air and so we figured that by examining the environmental factors of some Pittsburgh neighborhoods we could determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh as the one with the best environmental qualities.</p>\n",
